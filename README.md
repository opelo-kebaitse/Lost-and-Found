# üê± Lost and Found üê∂

## Sprint 7 Large group project

The focus of this app is to practice using the full stack that we teach in a larger-scale app.

"Lost and Found" is a community-based app designed to help people reunite with their missing pets and assist in finding stray animals. The idea of the app is to create a "billboard" style site for people to post about their animals that have gone missing, and for people who have found stray animals to post about them.

The hope is that within a small community this could be a great go-to for making sure those run-away floofs make it home safely.

Together, we'll turn every lost tail into a happy tale!

## Authentication

Authentication is already set up in the client side of this project using Auth0. Users are currently able to login and logout.

When you wish to protect your server side routes (those for registered users only), you may need to reference other exercises or materials.

If you wish to replace the Auth0 authentication with your own, so you can customise the login for example, you will need to update the `client/index.tsx` file of the project with your own Auth0 details.

## Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run before merging:
```sh
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run test
```
